**Hello!** Thank you for your interest. 

My name is Eric and I am interested in bringing forth meaningful impact with economics and data science.

Growing up with an international perspective has shaped my worldview and fostered adaptability. My academic journey has been grounded in rigorous training of economics, international relations, and quantitative methods. 

In the professional realm, I have thrived in the healthcare industry as a project manager. Over the years, I've navigated complex projects, honing my ability to strategize, collaborate, and deliver results in dynamic settings.

Currently seeking new opportunities, I am eagerly on the lookout for roles that allow me to integrate quantitative approaches and their broader applications into operational problem solving.
